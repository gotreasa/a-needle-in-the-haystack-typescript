A Needle in the Haystack - TypeScript repository

## Contributing

Please consult [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on contributing to this project.

## Description

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but contains one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example(Input --> Output)

```
["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5"
```
